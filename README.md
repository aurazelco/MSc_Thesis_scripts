## DATASETS

Below are listed the scripts for the analyses done for each individual dataset. 

### DISCO

The [DISCO](DISCO/) folder contains all scripts used on the DISCO dataset brain v1.0, found [here](https://www.immunesinglecell.org/atlasList). 

#### DEGs analysis on DISCO dataset - F vs M

This [folder](DISCO/DEGs) contains the analysis done on the DEGs between F and M started in August 2022. A brief description of the scripts can be found in the respective [README file](DISCO/DEGs/README.md). 

## SOFTWARES/ANALYSES

Below are listed general scripts done for all datasets. 

### Gene Regulatory Network Analysis

This analysis takes all genes expressed by the cells and search for regulatory networks

#### SCENIC

The [SCENIC](SCENIC/) folder contains a bash script to run the two main steps of SCENIC on all files contained in a folder, ran in October 2022. A brief description of the scripts can be found in the respective [README file](SCENIC/README.md).
