## Brief description of the Cistrome_DB scripts

* [cistrome_DB_TFs.R](cistrome_DB_TFs.R), [cistrome_DB_TFs_func.R](cistrome_DB_TFs_func.R)  - scripts to find the overlapping TFs between the GRNBoost2 SCENIC results (for both DISCO and UCSC) and the [Cistrome DB](http://cistrome.org/db/#/)

The file containing the TFs was copy-pasted from the Cistrome website (http://cistrome.org/db/#/) on 2023/01/11, selecting *Homo sapiens* as species and searching for the keyowrd *brain*.
