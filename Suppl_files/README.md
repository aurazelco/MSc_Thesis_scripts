# Brief description of the Suppl_files scripts

The following scripts were used to generate extra figures not plotted during the RDS preparation or DEGs analysis

* [Extra_figures_DISCO.R](Extra_figures_DISCO.R) - XIST, TMSB4X and TMSB4Y RNA expression
* [Extra_figures_Velmeshev.R](Extra_figures_Velmeshev.R) - TMSB4X and TMSB4Y RNA expression
* [num_cells.R](num_cells.R) - plots the number of cells in the datasets, divided by sex and cell type
* [num_cells_vs_DEGs.R](num_cells_vs_DEGs.R) - plots the number of cells *versus* the numebr of DEGs, divided by sex
* [pubmed_results.R](pubmed_results.R) - script that take as input csv files downloaded from Pubmed, and generates plots to show the absolute number and percentage of publication for the following queries:
    1. *"brain" AND "sex differences"*
    2. *"brain" AND "sex differences" AND "development"*
* [XIST.R](XIST.R) - plots the XIST expression in all datasets and the number of samples in each dataset, split by sex
